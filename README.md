Weights & Measures is a unit converter. Falling under the GNU General Public License, it it free software and comes with no warranty. Internally, the program uses floating-point numbers, which are not exact in their representation. From my own personal use, WM works fine for everyday, household calculations; but if one requires high accuracy or precision, I advise using a program that can guarantee that. Presently, WM is only meant for rough, household calculations—not life-critical work or where high precision is needed.
