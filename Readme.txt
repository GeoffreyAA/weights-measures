Weights & Measures
==================

Weights & Measures is a unit converter for Windows. Internally, it uses 64-bit floating-point numbers, which are not exact in their representation but, for everyday calculations, are all right. For life-critical work or extreme precision, another tool would be better suited to the task.

I hope Weights & Measures is of use to you.

Thanks,
Geoffrey


Notes
-----

The program comes with a default language of English and can be translated into others. Open the "English.lng" file in a plain-text editor, like Notepad, and translate all the words on the right-hand side of the equal-to (=) sign. Then, save it as another file, using UTF-8 encoding without the BOM, or byte-order mark. Lastly, rename the file to that of the language: "French.lng" for example. The extension must be ".lng" or the file will not be picked up. Language can be changed in Settings. Note that UTF-16 encoding will not work, and using the BOM is not advised; if the latter is used, the first string will simply be lost to the program. Plain ANSI encoding also works, but UTF-8, without the BOM, is recommended.

Only download Weights & Measures from its official page (https://github.com/GeoffreyAA/weights-measures). If you got it from somewhere else, please be aware that I had no hand in that, and it could be modified or infected. Also, this is free software, so do not pay for it anywhere.

It is recommended to use WM.exe, which is the 64-bit x86 build and should work on Windows 7 at least. The 32-bit build, WM32.exe, should work on Windows XP and pre-SSE2 CPUs.
