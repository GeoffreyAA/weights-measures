Weights & Measures can be compiled with Visual Studio 2026. Open the solution file, WM.sln, set the configuration, and compile; it is set to link statically, so no redistributable files should be needed. MFC must be installed:

	C++ MFC for x64/x86 (Latest MSVC)


To target XP, select the "Release-XP" configuration. The following components have to be installed:

	C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools
	MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)
	C++ MFC for v141 build tools (x86 & x64)
