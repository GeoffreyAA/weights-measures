Weights & Measures can be compiled with Visual Studio 2022. Just open the solution file, WM.sln, set the configuration, and compile. It is set to link statically, so no redistributable files should be needed.

To target XP, you will need to have the following installed. Then, select the "Release-XP" configuration and compile.

	C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools
	MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)
	C++ MFC for v141 build tools (x86 & x64)

This project originated on Visual C++ 6.0 and was only recently migrated to VS 2019/22, but the old project files are still there and do work. Just open "Convertor.dsw" in VC++ 6.0, add any missing source files to the project, and compile. Of course, if changes are made that VC++ 6.0 is not aware of, such as using newer language features, it is not going to work.

Thanks,
