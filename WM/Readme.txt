Weights & Measures is a unit converter. Licensed to you under the GNU General Public License, it it free software and comes with no warranty. Internally, the program uses floating-point numbers, which are not exact in their representation. From my own personal use, WM works fine for everyday, household calculations; but if one requires high accuracy or precision, I advise using a program that can guarantee that. Presently, WM is only meant for rough, household calculations—not life-critical work or where high precision is needed.

I hope Weights & Measures is of use to you.

Thanks,
Geoffrey Angapa


The program comes with a default language of English and can be translated into others quite easily. Open the "English.lng" file in a plain-text editor, like Notepad, and translate all the words on the right-hand side of the equal-to (=) sign. Then, save it as another file, using UTF-8 encoding, without the BOM or byte-order mark; and rename the file to that of the language: "Afrikaans.lng" for example. The extension must be ".lng" or the program will not be able to pick it up. Languages can be changed in Settings. Note that UTF-16 encoding will not work, and using the BOM is not advised; if the latter is used, the first string will simply be lost to the program. Plain ANSI encoding also works, but UTF-8, without the BOM, is recommended.

Only download Weights & Measures from its official page (https://github.com/GeoffreyAngapa/weights-measures). If you got it from somewhere else, please be aware that I had no hand in that, and it could be modified or infected. Also, this is free software, so do not pay for it anywhere.

It is recommended to use WM.exe, which is the 64-bit x86 build and ought to work on Windows 7 at least. The 32-bit build, WM32.exe, should work on Windows XP and pre-SSE2 CPUs.
